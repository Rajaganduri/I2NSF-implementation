# I2NSF-implementation

This project is under construction. This project is mainly aimed at achieving the translation of high level user input YANG data models to NSF understandable YANG models.
The translated data models are sent to NSF currently via Sockets.
The Security Controller (here, Translator) and the NSF run in separate VMs. Hence, while deploying in your local environment you need to modify the ip addresses to establish Socket communication among those two VMs.
As the project is still under construction, this project is being modified to suit to I2NSF's framework and guidelines.

Any suggestions can be directed to Rajasekhar Ganduri, Rajasekhar.Ganduri@huawei.com
